00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
this works

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.500
Oh, Miss Potts, if you find this recording, don't feel bad about this.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.500
Part of the journey is the end.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Just for the record, drifting through space with zero promise of rescue is more fun than it sounds.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.500
Food and water ran out four days ago. Oxygen will run out tomorrow morning.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I drifted off dreaming about you. Always you.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.500
But what did he say he would do?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.500
He wiped out 50% of all living creatures.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We lost all of them.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500
We lost friends. We lost family.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.500
We lost a part of ourselves.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.500
This is the fight of our lives.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.500
It's gonna work out, Steve, I know it, 'cause I don't know what I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Hi, is anyone home? This is Scott Lang.

00:00:57.500 --> 01:01.500
We met a few years ago at the airport in Germany. I got really big.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.500
Is this an old message?

01:04.500 --> 01:07.000
Ant-Man's on his way.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.000
I know you know me. You know this.

01:10.500 --> 01:12.500
That's the front door.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.500
That's me. Can you open up?

0 --> 01:12.500
Esa es la puerta de entrada.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.500
Soy yo. Â¿Puedes abrirme?
